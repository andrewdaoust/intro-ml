    "The two major supervised learning models are classification (iris example in ch. 1 was this kind) and __regression__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification has the goal of predicting class labels.  These types of problems are broken down ever further to __binary classification__ where the goal is to distinguish between exactly two classes (think of it like a yes/no question) and __multiclass classification__ where there are more than two classes to distinguish (the iris example was this type with its three class labels).\n",

    "Regression has the goal of predicting a continuous number.  Some examples where regression models might be used are :\n",
    "* predicting annual income based on education\n",
    "* yield of a corn farm given different environmental factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy way to distinguish which model to use: is there any continuity between the possible outcomes?  If so, regression is the way to go.  If results are discrete then classification is a better modelling strategy.\n",

    "##### Generalization, Overfitting, Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Models that predict accurately on unseen data is said to generalize well.  Intuitively we expect simpler models to generalize better so we want to find the simplest model.  Building a model that is too complex for the amount of info is called __overfitting__.  This occurs when a model is fit too closely to the particulars of a training set.  The opposite of this is __underfitting__, when a model is too simple and may perform poorly on even the test data.  We want to find a model in the middle of these the gives the best generalization performance.\n",
